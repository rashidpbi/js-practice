## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What is JavaScript?

<a name="Introduction"></a>

```javascript

// javascript is a dynamic programming language primarily used to create interactive behaviour on websites.its one of the core technologies of the web,alongside html and css

// javascript is used to "make  webpages alive". 

// javascript programs are called scripts.

// they can be written in webpage's html and run automatically as page loads

// they can run on which that have javascript engines. browsers have embedded js engines . eg: v8 in chrome

// functionalities of js depend on the environment on which it is run. nodejs running js can do functions like network requests, read/write arbritrary files etc.

// in-browser is abled to :-
// *handle user interaction
// *get and set cookies
// *communicate using newtork requests
// *add new html to the page


// js is build with the safety and privacy of user considerations.some of in-browser js safety-limitations are as follows:-
// *they dont have access to OS functions. they can't handle read/write operations on arbritary files in disk storage. 
// *they dont have permission to access to user devices like camera unless given explicit permission.
// *can't access to other windows or tabs unless set
// *can communicate effectively with the server which has supplied its webpages. but to communicate with websites from other domains, it has to follow different protocols.

// for different purposes in mind, different languages exists which are built on top of js. these are transpiled to js first inorder to be executed in browser .

// js is iniially created for browser only but is now used in other environments as well.
```
