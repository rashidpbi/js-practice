<a name="Code Structure"></a>

### 2.1 Statements and Semicolons

```javascript
// statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
// they are seperated by semicolons

// semicolons:
// in most cases semicolons are placed implicitely by js where its required . but there are cases when its not implicitely places though required. 
```

### 2.2 Strict Mode

```javascript
// use strict:
// By  introduction of ecmascript 2015 (es5), many new features were added and modified existing codes. To disable those changes and to have old code working, dont use strict mode. 
// always use it at the top of the code 

// modern javascript uses 'classes' and 'modules' that enables 'use strict' automatically that you dont want to declare explicitely
```
