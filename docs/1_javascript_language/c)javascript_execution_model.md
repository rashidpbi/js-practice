<a name="basics"></a>

### 3.1 Compilation vs Interpretation

```javascript
//Compilation:    Conversion of whole high level code to machine level at a time.
//Interpretation: Code executed line by line

//Javascript is just in time compiled. ie a compination of compilation and interpretation. JS executes code line by line, the engine finds frequently used code and compiles it to optimized machine code.
```

### 3.2 Notes on Bindings

```javascript
//The association of an identifier with a value is generally called a "binding."
```
